# laravel-traits
A collection of useful Laravel snippets in the form of easy to use traits.

## How to use?
Each of the traits will have slightly different directions for usage. For best results review the traits code and corresponding docs (if they exist). In general, you'll need to do the following:
* Require this package via Composer.
* Import `use` the trait at the top of the respective class.
* Then `use` the trait in the class.

### Trait docs
* [How to use CommandOutputPrefix](docs/01-CommandOutputPrefix.md)
* [How to use ControllerManagesSections](docs/02-ControllerManagesSections.md)

## TODO
- Figure out what version of Laravel this requires  
Essentially I know it works with Laravel 5+, but not what minimum version it requires.
- Add tests...nuff said.
